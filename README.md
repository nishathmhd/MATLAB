## Fuzzy Logic Controller for Intelligent Assistive Care Environment

This repository contains the implementation of a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) designed to regulate the environmental parameters in an intelligent assistive care environment. The controller specifically adjusts the fan speed based on inputs of temperature and humidity to maintain a comfortable living environment for disabled residents. 

### Features

- **Fuzzy Logic Controller Design**: Utilizes temperature and humidity inputs to control the fan speed.
- **Adaptive Control**: Automatically adjusts fan speed to provide optimal comfort based on current environmental conditions.
- **Intelligent Assistive Care**: Designed for a room within a small flat, aiming to improve the quality of life for disabled residents.
- **MATLAB Implementation**: The FLC is implemented using MATLAB's Fuzzy Logic Toolbox, ensuring robust and reliable performance.

### Repository Contents

- **Fuzzy Logic Code**: MATLAB scripts that define and implement the FLC.
- **Figures and Visualizations**: Includes membership function plots, control surface plots, and rule viewer screenshots to illustrate the FLC's design and functionality.
- **Benchmark Comparison**: Performance comparison of Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Simulated Annealing (SA) on CEC’2005 benchmark functions.

### Results

- **Fan Speed Control**: The FLC adjusts the fan speed effectively based on varying temperature and humidity levels.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Detailed comparison and performance analysis of GA, PSO, and SA on Sphere, Rastrigin, and Griewank functions in both 2D and 10D spaces.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the MATLAB scripts to explore the FLC design and implementation.
3. Run the provided scripts to see the FLC in action and observe the performance comparisons.

### Visualizations

- **FIS Structure and Rule Viewer**: Visual representation of the FLC’s structure and rule evaluation.
- **Control Surface Plot**: Demonstrates how the fan speed output varies with changes in temperature and humidity inputs.
